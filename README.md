# Face-Recognition

It will help to identify the registred person face 
 Aim and Objectives
# Aim:
To create a real-time face detection of the register person will get detcted with the help of open cv as an algorithm, the easy example to see open cv is Attendance making

➢The main objective of the project is to recognized the person with right propability.

➢ Using appropriate datasets for recognizing and interpreting data using machine learning.

➢ To show on the optical view finder of the camera module with the person name written during the identification.

# Abstract:
➢ A person is identified by their image which will be  detected by the live feed from the system’s camera.

➢ We have completed this project by using Opencv Algorthim.

➢ A lot of research is being conducted in the field of Computer Vision and Machine Learning (ML), where machines are trained to identify various objects from one another. Machine Learning provides various techniques through which various objects can be detected.

➢ One such technique is to use Opencv, which generates a small size trained model and makes ML integration easier.

# Introduction:
➢ This project is based on a Face recognition model with modifications. We are going to implement this project with Machine Learning.

➢ This project will help to identify the accuracy of the identification of the right person.

➢ Machine learning algorithms have proven to be very useful in pattern recognition and classification, and hence can be used for DImage recognition     as well.

➢ With the advent of computer vision and image processing, vision based Face recognition techniques are widely used in recent times. This technique provides numerous advantages over the conventional system such as quicker response and wider coverage area. Many algorithms are available for detection. 

➢Deep learning algorithms can learn the useful features for fdetection from a video source. Convolutional neural networks are a branch of deep learning that can extract topological properties from an image.

# OPENCV:
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products
➢Setup:
$ https://github.com/opencv/opencv


# Methodology:
The face recognition system is a program that focuses on implementing real time detection. It is a prototype of a new product that comprises of the main module, which helps to mainly recognised the person correctly.

#Face Recognition:

This Module is divided into two parts:

1]Face recognition

➢ Ability to detect the location of object in any input image or frame. The output is the bounding box coordinates on the detected object.

➢ For this task, initially the Dataset library Kaggle was considered but getting  google images or made our own dataset(images).

➢ This Datasets identifies object in a Bitmap graphic object and returns the bounding box image with annotation of object present in a given image.

2] Classification Detection

➢ Classification of the object based on the image.

➢ Hence Opencv which is a model library for image classification and vision was used.

➢ Opencv was used to train and test our model for various classes for image recognition. accuracy is about:89%

# Advantages:

➢Deep learning techniques have the advantage of extracting the features automatically, making this process more effective and dramatically improving the state-of-the-art in Image Classification and object detection methods

➢ It can then convey to the person who present in control room if it needs to be completely automated

➢ When completely automated no user input is required and therefore works with absolute efficiency and speed.

➢ It can work around the clock and therefore becomes more cost efficient.
  
# Application:
➢It will be help in institutions as taking the attendance is vast for each and every period.

➢ Can be used in AI define cars which help to recognised the person as unlock the car by recognizinf instead of using keys.

# Future Scope:
➢ As we know technology is marching towards automation, so this project is one of the step towards automation.

➢ Thus, for more accurate results it needs to be trained for more images, and for a greater number of epochs.

➢ As we know even in mobile phones we have the face recognition pattern which is the basic need in every phone as prove to be as more secure than other locks which is improving day by day.

➢ In future our model which can be trained and modified with just the addition of images can be very useful.

# Conclusion:
➢ In this project our model is trying to detect images and then showing it on view finder, liveand identifying thier faces.
